This is a merge of two projects about the DGT Centaur
EdNekebo spend a lot of time to describe the internal interfaces. With my Unix experience I will megre the best of both sides to a really potential project.
It was a long way to go before it was possible to expand the DGT Centaur software with new functions. Big thanks to Ed Nekebno, who
made the work on the DGT Centaur a lot easier with his decompilation. 
In the first step, I have released the option of saving games on a USB stick.
If other inventors want to take part of this project, feel free to be a part of this.
Big Thank's also for Topschachbenny starting the first Mods, codes, idea's and Hardwaresupport.

/download vailable releases as a image
/boot FAT partion for boot and config files, so any User can edit it with windows
/mnt only partition with write access - dynamic chessfiles and PGN export are there
/home/pi/v2 location for 80% of the V2 files
/etc/init.d location for startup parameters
