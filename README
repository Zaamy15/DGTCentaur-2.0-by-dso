This is a merge of two projects about the DGT Centaur
EdNekebo spend a lot of time to describe the internal interfaces. With my Unix experience I will megre the best of both sides to a really potential project.
Note by Topschach Benny: It was a long way to go before it was possible to expand the DGT Centaur software with new functions. Big thanks to Ed Nekebno, who
made the work on the DGT Centaur a lot easier with his decompilation. My previous work became obsolete and the development of functions is now based on Ed Nekebno's code.
With Dirk Sommerfeld, another specialist has found its way into this project. In the first step, we have released the option of saving games on a USB stick.
Dirk Sommerfeld has demonstrated enormous know-how here. Thanks to Ed Nekebno, Dirk can now also incorporate better and faster solutions at DGT Centaur.
If other inventors want to take part in this project, I would be happy to support them with a DGT Centaur. :-)
