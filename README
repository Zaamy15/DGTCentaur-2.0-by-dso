This is a merge of two projects about the DGT Centaur
EdNekebo spend a lot of time to describe the internal interfaces. With my Unix experience I will megre the best of both sides to a really potential project.
It was a long way to go before it was possible to expand the DGT Centaur software with new functions. Big thanks to Ed Nekebno, who
made the work on the DGT Centaur a lot easier with his decompilation. 
In the first step, we have released the option of saving games on a USB stick.
Thanks to Ed Nekebno, we can now also incorporate better and faster solutions at DGT Centaur.
If other inventors want to take part in this project, feel free to be a part of this.
Big Thank's also for Topschachbenny starting the first Mods, codes, idea's and Hardwaresupport.
